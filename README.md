## 👔 Welcome
Building software and technological solutions are part of my passion. Finding a problem and transforming it into a solution
is part of the game. I'm the founder of **Blue Shirt Studios**, an indie studio that will provide anyone with technological
solutions. If you have a "side-hustle", let us make it more than a side hustle. If I can inpire people to follow through with their dreams, then I did enough.
